I am a first-year Ph.D. student of Vision and Learning Lab in the Department of Electrical Science and Computer Engineering, University of California, Merced, advised by Prof. Ming-Hsuan Yang. 

I was a research intern from Jule, 2018 to August, 2018 at Tencent AI Lab. 

My research interest includes deep learning, machine learning and their applications in computer vision. Recently, I am interested in interpretability and robustness of deep learning.
